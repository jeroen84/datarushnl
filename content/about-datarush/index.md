## PERSONAL

{{< figure src="avatar.png" alt="image" caption="" class="left" >}}

Working with data and the latest technologies are a passion for me. I was very interested in computers in my early days, and learned myself to program at the age of 12 in various programming languages (Visual Basic, Pascal, Java). At high school I also developed interest in economics. These two interests â€“ economics and computer technologies -  strongly reflect my professional career. I get very excited when I am able to solve business challenges using the latest technologies available. Thereby I have the knowledge of and experience within the financial sector, as well as the technical skills to implement data driven projects related to business intelligence and data science.

## PROFESSIONAL SKILLS

Next to the hereinafter referred to technical skills, I have strong knowledge of institutional investments, both in a risk management role, as well as an investor role. I have experience with both public market investments (equities, bonds, swaps), as well as private market investments (private equity, infrastructure). Experience with IT implementation processes, both as a project leader and project member. I know how to communicate both with both programmers and the business.
